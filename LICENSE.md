## _W3 License for Compliant Code Only_
IMPORTANT: please see the [APCA integration compliance doc.](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/minimum_compliance)
### The Short Summary, TL;DR:
Files in this repository are licensed to the W3/AGWG under their cooperative agreement for use with WCAG accessibility guidelines for web-delivered and web-based content only, and not for any other use. Certain limitations do apply.

Use of the terms "SAPC", "SACAM", "APCA", "Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", "Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", to describe any contrast method, app, or device, is only permitted for code that is correctly implemented, maintained, and up to date, per the [APCA integration compliance](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/minimum_compliance) page.

Code or implementations found to be non-compliant with APCA, meaning they are incorrect in operation or methodology as defined for APCA contrast, including but not limited to the indication of polarity, and use of the current approved constants, **shall be deemed in breech of license and a copyright violation.**

All code instantiations where are public facing in any way are required to follow the base algorithm as defined. Current base reference algorithm is 0.0.98G-4g WITH an output clamp at approximately ±Lc10 (for reference, this is the underlying algorithm for apca-w3 versions 0.1.9)

## DEPENDENCIES
Any dependencies created by and provided by Myndex Research or Andrew Somers as part of the apca-w3 package @ npm, or this repository, are hereby included by reference within this license, including but not limited to the Color Parsley package, when these dependencies are used with APCA–W3.

## W3/AGWG/WCAG VERSION DISCLAIMER AND RESTRICTIONS

_**DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF USE:**_       
**apca-w3** is an embodiment of certain supra-threshold contrast
prediction technologies and it is licensed to the W3 on a
limited basis for use in WCAG accessibility guidelines
for web content only. **apca-w3**  may be used for 
predicting contrast for web content used for that
specific purpose without royalty.

Said license excludes other use cases
not related to web content. Prohibited uses include
medical, clinical evaluation, human safety related,
aerospace, transportation, military applications, 
and uses which are not specific to web-based content
presented on self-illuminated displays or devices.

_**RIGHT TO AUDIT CODE**_     
Any integration of APCA, SAPC, or SACAM which is in a commercial app or behind a paywall, free access must be provided to Myndex Research, or their assigns, on request, for the purpose of evaluating and verifying correct operations and implementation of the APCA/SAPC/SACAM functions.

_**NO ALTERATION; KEEP CURRENT**_     
Any **apca-w3** files in this repository may be used or incorporated only in tools for web-based content or web related content in support of the WCAG accessibility guidelines, and such use must be without modification to the essential elements of the code or specific approved constants, except as required to port to a given language.

- Developers are highly encouraged to use the npm package(s) when possible:  ` npm i apca-w3 `

- Developers incorporating this code into their applications, widgets, or other tools, have a duty to ensure that the most recent version of this code is used in their current or any future release. 

- Breaking change exception:
    - developers do not need to incorporate future versions of **apca-w3** that have breaking changes when their release is only a minor or patch version per semantic versioning.
    - developers with minor or patch revisions are still obligated to use the latest non-breaking branch of **apca-w3**.
    - developers with a major revision per semantic versioning are obligated to use the most recent stable **apca-w3**.

_**USE OF APCA TERMINOLOGY**_     
- Use of the acronyms APCA™, SAPC™, or SACAM, or the terms "Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm"™, "Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm"™, or "Readability Contrast"™, to describe any embodiment, integration, or instantiation of contrast determination, method, or math, including the APCA code base or libraries, **is only permitted for code that is properly implementing the APCA algorithm, and maintaining sync with the current version. At this writing, current base algorithm formula is version 0.0.98G-4g or later.**

_**USE OF THE APCA LOGO AND TRADEMARK**_     
- Use of the APCA logo as shown at this repo to describe any contrast app, use, or method, or the "Powered by APCA" logo, and/or any related official logos or trademarks, **are prohibited without written consent** from Myndex™ Technologies, Myndex™ Research, Andrew Somers, and/or the authorized agents or assigns.
- Developers wishing to use the APCA or "Powered by APCA" logos or trademarks **must submit their application or tools for qualification** to be granted a limited license to use the APCA or "Powered by APCA" logos or trademarks in association with their tools.
- Formal details on the APCA and "Powered by APCA" qualification process are pending. In the interim, make a qualification request in the discussion tab of this repo.
