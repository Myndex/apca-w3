# APCA-W3
Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm for W3C & WCAG3

## SYNOPSIS
APCA is a contrast assessment method for predicting the perceived contrast between sRGB colors on a computer monitor. It has been developed as an assessment method for W3 Silver/WCAG3 accessibility standards relating to content for computer displays and mobile devices, with a focus on readability and understandability.

The APCA version in this repository is licensed to the W3/AGWG per the collaborative agreement with specific limitations and exclusions. Please see the license file for details. 


## QUICKSTART

---
### Node Install

    npm i apca-w3

### Imports

```
<script type="module">

import { APCAcontrast, reverseAPCA, sRGBtoY, displayP3toY, adobeRGBtoY,
         alphaBlend, calcAPCA, fontLookupAPCA } from 'apca-w3';

import { colorParsley, colorToHex, colorToRGB } from 'colorparsley';
// optional string parsing, and a dependency only for calcAPCA().

</script>
```

## USAGE
Parsing of color strings is handled by the colorparsley library. The rgb colors are passed to the various helper functions as simple arrays. APCAcontrast() takes a pre-calculated Ys (estimated screen luminance)


### Parsing:    
If you need to parse a color string or 24bit number, use the colorParsley() function:

    let rgbaArray = colorParsley('aliceblue');

### Alpha Blend:    
Intended for blending the foreground color into the background. Only the foreground has an alpha. There is no conversion to linear space, so blending takes place is the working colorspace, as is standard.

```javascript
                   // Send 0-255 arrays alphaBlend(FG, BG)
let alphaBlended = alphaBlend([0,0,0,0.6],colorParsley([255,255,255])),

                   // Send 0-1.0 float arrays for displayP3toY, 5th element
                  // is bool (false for floats): alphaBlend(FG, BG, false)
let alphaBlended = alphaBlend([0.7,1.0,1.0,0.33],colorParsley([0,0,0]),false);
```

### Convert To Ys:    
Send rgba INT array `[123,123,123,1.0] ` to ` sRGBtoY() ` â€” this is a slightly different luminance Y that the IEC piecewise.

    let Ys = sRGBtoY([123,123,123,1.0]);

Note that for for sRGB and Adobe98, the values in the array must be 0.0-255.0 per CSS4 specs, but for displayP3toY(), the values must be 0.0-1.0, per Apple and CSS4 specs. 

### Find Lc Contrast:    
First color _must_ be text, second color must be the background.

    let textColor = [17,17,17,1.0];
    let backgroundColor = [232,230,221,1.0];

    let contrastLc = APCAcontrast( sRGBtoY( textColor ), sRGBtoY( backgroundColor ) );

Example using everything together, including alphaBlend:

    let colorTEXT =  rgb(12,23,34,0.65);
    let colorBG =  #e6e0dd;

    let Lc = APCAcontrast(sRGBtoY( alphaBlend(colorParsley(colorTEXT),
             colorParsley(colorBG)) ), sRGBtoY( colorParsley(colorBG) ));

### Shortcut Alias:    
The long complete line shown above is aliased into a function ` calcAPCA() `. Alpha for the text is automatically detected, and ignored if 1 or ''. The input type is also auto detected (string, kind of string, number, array, object). By default returns a signed float -108.0 to 106.0 (approx)

    let Lc = calcAPCA(colorTEXT,colorBG);


### Font Size Array:    
This version includes an interpolated font size array.
Send `fontLookupAPCA(contrast)` a contrast value, and it returns an array, with the contrast (Lc) as the zeroth element, then 9 font sizes in px corresponding to weights 100 thru 900:

    ['LcValue',100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900]

Example:

    fontArray = fontLookupAPCA(-68.541);    
    console.log(fontArray) // -68.541,67,40,28,20.5,18.5,16.5,15,416,418

Thus the 400 weight font is indicating 20.5px

### Reverse APCA:    
New in this version is a reverse contrast lookup. Specify a contrast, and one color (i.e. bg) and it will try to find a color with that contrast.

**Notes on reverseAPCA():**    
1. Currently only returns a greyscale color
2. If a color can not fit the contrast, or other error, returns false.
    - A small overrun/underrun of a few percent is permitted.
3. Can return a hex string (default) or an array of RGBA values, with the fifth element a string indicating if the color is for text or bg.

    reverseAPCA (Lc, knownY, knownType = 'bg', returnAs = 'hex')

### String Theory:    
See the colorparsley package for documentation on the available string inputs.

colorParsley() is a dependency for the shorthand ` calcAPCA() `


### Two Hidden Parameters
There are two extra parameters for calcAPCA(), and one extra for APCAcontrast.

    calcAPCA( text, BG, places, isInt(bool) )
    APCAcontrast ( txYs, bgYs, places = -1 )
    alphaBlend( txt, BG, round(bool) )

` places ` defaults to -1, but you can send it 0 and the Lc is returned as a rounded value, and instead of a minus sign for polarity, 'WoB' for white on black is returned.

` isInt ` or `round` defaults to true, as we assume the RGB tuples are 0-255. If you are sending float such as for displayP3, then set ` round = false ``

_NOTE: neither of these are "official" and may change, move, or vanish._

## VERSION INFORMATION
Current Algorithm Version: **0.0.98G-4g** (February 15, 2021) (w3) 

This is the base algorithm version. The versions listed below are for the overall library file, as features and functions are added to aide in integration. These added features do not impact the base algorithm which is stable and undergoing public beta validation.

Current Library Version: **0.1.9** (w3) (98G4g) _beta_
- See [Version History](#version-history) for details.

### Font Lookup Table
Current as of May 27, 2022

**Notes on the lookups:**
- This is a basic table for fluent readability of text. Text that is intended to be read (primary content) should meet or exceed the values on the table.
- For body text, add Lc 15 for any value on the table lower than Lc 75.
- For instance, if using a 24px font, add Lc 15 to the minimum contrast value
- For sub-fluent text (i.e. not primary content) Lc values can be lowered by Lc 15, but in no case less than Lc 30.
- For non-fluent spot text (copyright bug, disabled text, placeholder) Lc values can be lowered by Lc25, but in no case less than Lc 30.
- Fonts larger than 24px and weight 300 or more have a maximum contrast of Lc 90.

### Disclaimer:
APCA is being evaluated as a replacement for WCAG 2 contrast math for future standards and guidelines, however, standards that will be incorporating APCA are still developmental. Because WCAG 2 contrast math does not accurately model human visual perception nor visual impairments, there will be discrepancies between WCAG 2 contrast math, and perceptually uniform models such as APCA. It is up to the end user to determine suitability of purpose for their region and conformance requirements.
