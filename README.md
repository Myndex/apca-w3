# [APC<span class="flipH">A</span>](https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3)<sup>™</sup> [for W3C & WCAG3](https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3)

## _Welcome!_ 
APCA is the **Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm**, a new way to predict contrast for text and non-text content on self illuminated displays.

The correct code to use is right here ***apca-w3*** in this satellite repository, and is also available at `npm i apca-w3` code here is the only code that should be used for any development purposes. Please post _issues_ at the [main repository](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/issues).

The draft [**APCA Readability Criterion**](https://readtech.org/ARC/) is up as a work in progress, still sections to be added and/or adjusted.

For comments or questions on the _guidelines_, use the [ARC forum](https://github.com/A11yReadTech/ARC/discussions), over at Accessible Reading Technologies, as that is where we discuss the draft standards & guidelines, and discuss legal & conformance issues. 

For comments or questions on _theory, math, or the APCA algorithm_ itself, use the [SAPC-APCA forum](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions) at the main repository, please post all comments, questions, or discussions regarding theory, math, code, third-party tools, third-party tools, and so forth, there and not here in this satellite repository, so they can be tracked and resolved.

### [LIVE VERSION][APCAsite]
There is a working version with examples and reference material on [the APCA demo tool site][APCAsite]

[APCAsite]: https://www.myndex.com/APCA/

------
## _QUICKSTART_
### _Install_

```javascript
    npm i apca-w3
```

### _Import_
```javascript

    <script type="module">

    import { APCAcontrast, reverseAPCA, sRGBtoY, displayP3toY, adobeRGBtoY, alphaBlend, calcAPCA, fontLookupAPCA } from 'apca-w3';

    import { colorParsley, colorToHex, colorToRGB } from 'colorparsley';  // optional string parsing

    </script>
```

### _Usage:_
#### PARSE:    
If you need to parse a color string or 24bit number, use the colorParsley() function:

```javascript
    let rgbaArray = colorParsley('aliceblue');
```
#### ALPHA BLEND:     
Intended for blending the foreground color into the background. Only the foreground has an alpha. There is no conversion to linear space, so blending takes place is the working colorspace, as is standard.

```javascript
                       // Send 0-255 arrays alphaBlend(FG, BG)
    let alphaBlended = alphaBlend([0,0,0,0.6],colorParsley([255,255,255])),

                       // Send 0-1.0 float arrays for displayP3toY, 5th element
                      // is bool (false for floats): alphaBlend(FG, BG, false)
    let alphaBlended = alphaBlend([0.7,1.0,1.0,0.33],colorParsley([0,0,0]),false);
```

#### CONVERT TO Ys:    
Send rgba INT array `[123,123,123,1.0] ` to ` sRGBtoY() ` — this is a slightly different luminance Y that the IEC piecewise.

```javascript
    let Ys = sRGBtoY([123,123,123,1.0]);
```
Note that for for sRGB and Adobe98, the values in the array must be 0.0-255.0 per CSS4 specs, but for displayP3toY(), the values must be 0.0-1.0, per Apple and CSS4 specs. 

#### FIND Lc CONTRAST:    
First color _must_ be text, second color must be the background.

```javascript
    let textColor = [17,17,17,1.0];
    let backgroundColor = [232,230,221,1.0];
    
    let contrastLc = APCAcontrast( sRGBtoY( textColor ), sRGBtoY( backgroundColor ) );
```
Example using everything together, including alphaBlend:

```javascript

    let colorTEXT =  rgb(12,23,34,0.65);
    let colorBG =  #e6e0dd;

    let Lc = APCAcontrast(sRGBtoY( alphaBlend(colorParsley(colorTEXT), colorParsley(colorBG)) ),
                        sRGBtoY( colorParsley(colorBG) ));
```
#### SHORTCUT ALIAS:
The long complete line shown above is aliased into a function ` calcAPCA() `. Alpha for the text is automatically detected, and ignored if 1 or ''. The input type is also auto detected (string, king of string, number, array, object). By default returns a signed float -108.0 to 106.0 (approx)

```javascript
    let Lc = calcAPCA(colorTEXT,colorBG);
```

### NEW! Font Size Array
New in this version is an interpolated font size array. Send `fontLookupAPCA(contrast)` a contrast value, and it returns an array, with the contrast (Lc) as the zeroth element, then 9 font sizes in px corresponding to weights 100 thru 900:

    ['LcValue',100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900]

Example:

    fontArray = fontLookupAPCA(-68.541);

    console.log(fontArray) // -68.541,67,40,28,20.5,18.5,16.5,15,416,418

Thus the 400 weight font is indicating 20.5px

### NEW! Reverse APCA 
New in this version is a reverse contrast lookup. Specify a contrast, and one color (i.e. bg) and it will try to find a color with that contrast.

#### NOTES:
1. Currently only returns a greyscale color
2. If a color can not fit the contrast, or other error, returns false.
    - A small overrun/underrun of a few percent is permitted.
3. Can return a hex string (default) or an array of RGBA values, with the fifth element a string indicating if the color is for text or bg.

```javascript
    reverseAPCA (Lc, knownY, knownType = 'bg', returnAs = 'hex')
```

### _String Theory_
See the colorparsley package for documentation on the available string inputs.

colorParsley() is a dependency for the shorthand ` calcAPCA() `


### _Two Bonus Parameters_
There are two extra parameters for calcAPCA(), and one extra for APCAcontrast.

```javascript
    calcAPCA( text, BG, places, isInt )
    APCAcontrast ( txYs, bgYs, places = -1 )
    alphaBlend( txt, BG, round(bool) )
```

` places ` defaults to -1, but you can send it 0 and the Lc is returned as a rounded value, and instead of a minus sign for polarity, 'WoB' for white on black is returned.

` isInt ` or `round` defaults to true, as we assume the RGB tuples are 0-255. If you are sending float such as for displayP3, then set ` isInt = false ``

_NOTE: neither of these are "official" and may change, move, or vanish._

## _APCA-W3 Basic Math (sRGB)_

<img width="420" alt="the math for the basic APCA" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Myndex/apca-w3/master/images/APCAw3_0.1.17_APCA0.0.98G.svg">

## _Accessibility Statement for Beta Sites_
Beta testers may wish to include the following statement in their site's boilerplate:

### This website is beta testing the APCA guidelines for determining text and non-text contrast. It is well known that WCAG 2 contrast maths are not accurate regarding human perception, and automated testing using WCAG 2 math may incorrectly indicate errors in some color pairs on this site. The APCA guidelines are a substantial improvement in accessibility over WCAG 2 contrast criterions, and therefore compliant with the ADA, and also 508 rules under the alternative methods section. Any automated or manual testing done to determine conformance of this site needs to be conducted using a perceptually accurate method such as APCA.


## _VERSION INFORMATION_

### Current Algorithm Version: **0.0.98G-4g** (February 15, 2021) (w3) 
This is the base algorithm version. The other version numbering as [listed below](#version-history) are for the overall library file, relating to features and functions are added to aide in integration. These added features do not impact the base algorithm which is stable and undergoing public beta validation.

### Current Library Version: **0.1.9** (w3) (98G4g) _beta_
- See [Version History](#version-history) for details.


### Font Lookup Table
Current as of May 27, 2022

**Notes on the lookups:**
- This is a basic table for fluent readability of text. Text that is intended to be read (primary content) should meet or exceed the values on the table.
- For body text, add Lc 15 for any value on the table lower than Lc 75.
- For instance, if using a 24px font, add Lc 15 to the minimum contrast value
- For sub-fluent text (i.e. not primary content) Lc values can be lowered by Lc 15, but in no case less than Lc 30.
- For non-fluent spot text (copyright bug, disabled text, placeholder) Lc values can be lowered by Lc25, but in no case less than Lc 30.
- Fonts larger than 24px and weight 300 or more have a maximum contrast of Lc 90.

### APCA is the _Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm_
## THE REVOLUTION WILL BE READABLE<sup>™</sup>

---

<sub>**Disclaimer:** _APCA is being evaluated as a replacement for WCAG 2 contrast math for future standards and guidelines, however, standards that will be incorporating APCA are still developmental. Because WCAG 2 contrast math does not accurately model human visual perception nor visual impairments, there will be discrepancies between WCAG 2 contrast math, and perceptually uniform models such as APCA. It is up to the end user to determine suitability of purpose for their region and conformance requirements._</sub>
